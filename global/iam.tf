# iam.tf creates the global IAM policies for the organization
# It was initially generated by the GCP organization setup tool
# resource names follow a convention of <principal>-<resource>-<optional description>
# for example, for a given principal (usually a group), we assign a list of roles for a given resource


# We use the terraform-google-modules GitHub organization, specifically the iam repo and its TF modules
# they expose modules to declare IAM policies for organizations, folders, projects, etc.
# https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-iam
# Just remember that roles are inherited, if we assign a role to a folder,
# it will be inherited by all projects and resources under that folder

# Not all polies are managed by terraform, such as billing account permissions and organization ownership
# These are managed manually to ensure that we don't accidentally remove them with `terraform destroy`
